# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, where you can find information about me, my projects and skills. This portfolio has been created using Next.js technology, which has allowed me to build a highly performant and scalable web application. Also, Next.js has given me the flexibility to use different tools and libraries, which has resulted in a clean and attractive design for the users, I hope you enjoy it!

# Initializing the project
To initialize the project, you must first install the necessary dependencies. You can do this using yarn or npm at the command line:

```bash
yarn install

```
or

```bash
 npm install

```

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the project using the following command:


```bash
yarn dev
```
or
```bash
npm run dev

```
This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser at localhost:3000.
